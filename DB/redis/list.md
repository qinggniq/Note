## List

```c
/* quicklist is a 40 byte struct (on 64-bit systems) describing a quicklist.
 * 'count' is the number of total entries.
 * 'len' is the number of quicklist nodes.
 * 'compress' is: -1 if compression disabled, otherwise it's the number
 *                of quicklistNodes to leave uncompressed at ends of quicklist.
 * 'fill' is the user-requested (or default) fill factor.
 * 'bookmakrs are an optional feature that is used by realloc this struct,
 *      so that they don't consume memory when not used. */
